          <p>Research: jet tagging techniques (applying deep learning, ideas from AI safety).
            With the help of latest architectures like transformer models, I am developing a new generation of algorithms which exploit low-level features in a unique way.
            My particular interest is targeted at improving not only performance, but also at creating robust taggers that can withstand input distortions and which generalize
            better to experimental data, being trained on (augmented) simulation only.
            For Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider, CMS will use the first (adversarially) robust tagger in production, and I am looking forward to analyses profiting from this development.
            Studies so far are summarized <a href="publications.html">here</a>. Further activities related to this topic, in an interdisciplinary way, are now coordinated on <a href="https://github.com/ErUM-AISafety" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
            The tools under investigation play a crucial role when studying the properties of the Higgs boson, for example when probing
            the coupling to charm quarks. I set up a first implementation of the VHcc Zll channel in a pure python framework which can be
            used for further studies and improvements, compared to the Run 2 version.</p>
          <p>
            Service work for CMS: extending a specialized data tier / framework to study jet tagging algorithms with additional
            variables that are relevant for commissioning. Code reviews and contributions for commissioning, efficiently hunting üêõ in the code.
            Providing a new skim for monitoring purposes of b-tagging observables at HLT.
            Implementation of adversarial training for next generation of flavour tagging algorithms (used starting from Run3).
            Building a new software framework that allows training and evaluation in one go.<br>
