          <p>Research: jet tagging techniques (applying deep learning, ideas from AI safety).
            The tools under investigation play a crucial role when studying the properties of the Higgs boson, for example when probing
            the coupling to c quarks.</p>
          <p>
            Service work for CMS: extending a specialized data tier / framework to study jet tagging algorithms with additional
            variables that are relevant for commissioning, where I casually help improving the framework with code that was used in different contexts.
            Providing a new skim for monitoring purposes of b-tagging observables at HLT.
            Implementation of adversarial training for next generation of flavour tagging algorithms (to be used in Run3).<br>
